# ML-Lab-Project
In this project, I analyze a Hyper Spectral image of the Indian Pines dataset and experiment with K-Means clustering to best group the pixels of the Image into categories. The result of each different clustering is evaluated using Accuracy, Silhouette and Rand score metrics of the SK-Learn package.

Enjoy : )
